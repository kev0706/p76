    <h1>Black Holes</h1>
    <p>Today I am going to explain to you about black holes. They have so much gravity that they can eat light up, so they are black. Black means almost invisible, so sometimes we see them and sometimes we don't.since they suck everything up like a hole, they are called black holes. Down below is everything you need to know about Black holes.</p>

              <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"> The Largest Black Hole in the Universe</h5>
              <p>The Largest black hole in the Universe is a Ultramassive black hole called TON 618. It is so huge that it could fit 7 Solar systems, side by side inside it. That is humungous and nothing is comparable to its size! The second largest black hole is also humungous because it is 3 Solar systems wide and is called NGC 4889. It is so large that it has a supermassive black hole orbiting it! The Unniverse truly is a strange place.</p>

              <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">How Black holes were formed</h5>
              <p>Primordial black holes are thought to have formed in the early universe, soon after the big bang. Stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself. This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space. But this does not explain how the largest black holes have formed. Something must have happened, because the universe is simply not old enough. We will need the largest stars in existence to form these humungous black holes: Quasi stars. Quasi stars are much larger than the current largest stars in the universe. The star must have been so large that the black hole must have been made when the star was formng. A deadly balance could emerge: The gravity fed the black hole so fast, heating it to such a degree that the radiation pressure could have kept the star stable. Then the black hole woud have consumed it and become much larger than any other black hole.</p></div></div></body></html>
